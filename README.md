# SquarePants

## Introduction
SquarePants is a yet another library to define layouts on iOS. It is different than most others in a few ways:

- It decouples layout from the view itself, until the moment where the layout is applied.
- It calculates resulting layout values lazily on-demand.
- It takes advantage of Swift 2 protocol extensions to provide a flexible API.

## Installation

It is recommended you use Carthage to install SquarePants. Simply add the following to your `Cartfile`:

```ruby
github "sebreh/SquarePants" "master"
```

## Usage

Example usage:

```swift
// Create a layout
let layout = view.sp_makeLayout { make in
  make.size.fitContent()
  make.y.equal(20)
  make.center.centerInSuperview(axis: .Vertical)
  make.alpha.equal(0.4)
}

// Apply the layout. The resulting values will not be evaluated until apply() is called
layout.apply()

// Alternatively, apply the layout immediately by calling sp_layout(_)
view.sp_layout { $0.size.fitContent() }
```
